# BTC-prediction
predicts the price of BTC in USD based on historical data and senitment analysis

1) Developed a Bitcoin price prediction model using LSTM and integrating FinBERT-based sentiment analysis in python on real-time Reddit data to forecast hourly price movements. Utilized key libraries such as TensorFlow, Transformers (Hugging Face), PRAW, Pandas, yFinance, and Scikit-learn.

2) Created a data pipeline that merges hourly Bitcoin price data from Yahoo Finance with Reddit sentiment scores, making sure the timestamps line up for accurate modeling.

3) Created a user-friendly web interface using streamlit, where users can choose how far into the future they want to predict Bitcoin prices and see clear, easy-to-understand visuals showing the expected price trend and percentage change
